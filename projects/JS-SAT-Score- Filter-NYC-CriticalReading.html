            <h1 class="margin text-center">Critical Reading NYC SAT scores filter</h1>
            <p> For this project we worked with  data from NYC open data base API and looked through them thinking of the possible ideas for how to use them.
              I chose to work with the 2012 SAT Results and wanted to create a code that filtered through all of the sections giving the user a list of schools 
              based on the section they wanted and the scores they wanted. My initial idea seems easy to me, but with the time i had i soon realized it would better if
              I focoused on something more specific while still keeping the same concept. I decided I wanted to filter though the Critical reading section to give the user
              a list of schools with the score they input. I felt like having a smaller target would be easier to start off with then in the future I could expand if I wished to.
          Initially some of the challenges I faced were getting the data to show up on the screen. I was unsure how to work with the data since it didn't have a name, but I figured out that 
          I could refer to it as data and use a loop to filter through the different schools. Once I figured out how to get the data on the screen creating the loop was easier 
          and I made it so that if the userinput equaled  the critical reading score in the data it would document.log that schools name. When trying to work with a bigger target
          I encountered many errors and decided a smaller target would be best to prefect the code then build from there which was another one of my struggles.
          My code wasn't focoused on a certain section and I was trying to do to much causing errors all around my code.</p>
            <p>For my next steps I feel like the only way to go from here is adding a loop to filter through the math and writing scores. This was my initial idea so it would be nice to build up to having it play out.
          Once they are worked out I would also like to see if i could loop it so that the user can be asked for scores in other sections and give them those options all together. Maybe 
          I could even make it so that they can input a rage of scores and I can provide their "perfect match" of schools. I also want to add some CSS and organize the information into some sort of accordian. </p>
